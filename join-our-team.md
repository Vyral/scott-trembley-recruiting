<p>Dear Fellow or Future Real Estate Agent:</p>

<p>We understand that right now you may be frustrated with the current state of your career. Perhaps you’ve already found success in the real estate industry, but find yourself lacking in the consistency, support, and direction you desire. Even those with the drive and skill to produce between $1 and $10 million in sales may feel this same exasperation. Without the right environment, agents are simply unable to thrive.</p>

<p>Or perhaps you are working as a sales professional in another industry, but have been considering the switch to a real estate career.</p>

<p>In either case, the bottom line is this: Something has to change. Yet, as those of you already in the industry will know, not every brokerage out there will offer you a path to true success. <strong>Did you know that 87% of people who get their real estate license will drop out of the industry in their first two to five years?</strong> That means nine out of every 10 agents fail before they ever really get a chance to win. So why does this happen?</p>

<p>As I mentioned before, most brokerages don’t offer agents any support. This leaves agents to fend for themselves, spending their own money and resources on tools and tactics that never seem to pay off. <strong>To achieve long-term success, agents need support, structure, coaching, training, accountability, marketing and, of course, leads.</strong></p>

<p>Getting into a real estate career can either feel like the best or the worst decision in your life. The difference comes down to the environment you choose, and how you use that environment to your advantage. The right resources and support can take your career from bleak to booming, and this is exactly what we at The Trembley Group are offering you.</p>

<p>Our mission here at The Trembley Group is to deliver 6-star (not just 5-star) service to every client, partner, agent we work with, and to our own team members as well. Our goal has been to be the No. 1 reviewed company in our market and, eventually, in the real estate industry, overall.</p>

<p>Right now, we are the No. 1 reviewed company on Zillow in our market. With 740 + positive reviews on that platform, we’re well on our way to being one of the top-reviewed companies in our industry.</p>

<p><strong>My name is Scott Trembley, and today I’m going to tell you why joining our team is your best bet at success in this industry.</strong> I’ve been in real estate for more than 20 years, have helped over 4,000 families achieve their real estate goals, and have trained more than 100 agents in the past 10 years. All that said, I know what it takes to succeed in real estate.</p>

<p>In the short time since I founded the The Trembley Group three years ago, we have been recognized as the fastest-growing team in our market. Whether you’re working in sales in another industry and are thinking of making a change, or you’re already an agent but crave more direction, we can help put you on the path to a better career and a better life.</p>

<p>According to the Coastal Carolina Association of Realtors, The Trembley Group is the place to go if you want to learn the business and learn it fast. <strong>Here are just a few of the resources we offer to our agents:</strong>
<ul class="indent">
<li>High-level coaching</li>
<li>Mentorship program for brand new agents </li>
<li>Mastermind groups, Mentoring & Role-play sessions</li>
<li>In-depth training</li>
<li>Bonus plans </li>
<li>Real accountability</li>
<li>The best customer resource management (CRM) system in the Industry</li>
<li>Your own website</li>
<li>Individual branding and marketing</li>
<li>Marketing Team that markets your listings</li>
<li>6-star Support from our Transaction Department </li>
<li>7-days-a-week 6-star Support from our elite Inside Sales Agent (ISA) team</li>
<li>An encouraging and uplifting culture that is second-to-none</li>
<li>Built-in Raving Fan Referral Plan to keep in touch with all your past clients</li>
<li>Systems that work</li>
<li>Office and desk space</li>
<li>Not just LEADS but 15 to 25 Qualified appointments monthly </li>
<li>And much more</li>
</ul></p>

<p>We have studied the top Real Estate teams/firms in the United States for the last three years to lay out a scaled commission package that is second-to-none in our industry giving the above resources and crazy value our company brings to its super star agents. We are also the only firm in this area that is set up for strong leaders looking to build their own team within our incredible environment.  (ACTIVE AGENTS PRODUCING IN OUR MARKET TODAY WOULD START AT THE COMMISSION LEVEL THAT MATCHES THEIR CURRENT ANNUAL PRODUCTION. IE: AN AGENT PRODUCING $6M+ IN THEIR LAST 12 MONTHS WOULD START AT THE THIRD FEARLESS LEVEL).</p>

<p>Our Commission Structure:</p>

<p><strong>HEART LEVEL</strong> - Up To $2.5 Million In Closed Volume
Brand New Agents: 60% commission on self-generated business & 40% on qualified company leads. You have an in-house mentor at this level.</p>

<p><strong>COACHABLE LEVEL</strong> - $2.5M To $6M In Closed Volume
Second Tier: 70% commission on self-generated business & 45% on qualified company leads. An additional 10% bonus each month on the third sale & beyond on company-generated business.</p>

<p><strong>FEARLESS LEVEL</strong> - $6 Million+ In Closed Volume
Third Tier: 75% commission on self-generated business & 50% on qualified company leads. An additional 10% bonus each month on the third sale & beyond on company-generated business.</p>

<p>The reason we offer all of this is simple. We want our agents to be more than just great real estate professionals; we want our agents to develop into the most-trusted leaders in the industry. By joining our team, you’ll be on the fast track to helping upwards of 40 families on an annual basis, while also earning six figures and beyond once you enter your second year.</p>

<p><strong>You could try one of these alternative options:</strong>
<ol class="indent">
<li>You could work for a competing broker and pay for your own materials and training with no success to show for it.</li>
<li>You could sell 4-8 homes a year with no business plan or strategically sell 38 + homes annually with us.</li>
<li>You could try to start your own team with no support and struggle to maintain a balance between hiring, training, selling, and more.</li>
<li>You could leave the industry or stay in your current 9-to-5 with no end goal in sight.</li>
</ol></p>

<p><strong>But why test your luck at replicating the kind of success that, when you join us, is a sure thing?</strong> If you follow the path we’ve laid out, you’ll find your goals are much closer than you think. At The Trembley Group, we offer you the chance to build a career and a life you want, all while allowing you the freedom to enjoy that life. Encouraging strong families is as important to us as encouraging strong real estate careers. This commitment is part of what sets our team apart, along with our core values—which are:
<ul class="indent">
<li>Winning Attitude</li>
<li>Coachable</li>
<li>Heart</li>
<li>Fearless</li>
<li>The 100/0 Principle: 100% accountability, zero excuses.</li>
</ul></p>

<p>But don’t just take my word for it. <strong>Consider this success story from one of our great agents:</strong></p>

<p class="indent">During the Christmas party we held at the end of our first year in business, our team was sitting around and sharing our favorite memories from the year. We laughed, cried, and reminisced on all the ways our lives (and the lives of our clients) had changed. When the bartender who was working at the party heard this, she chimed in and told us that hearing our stories made her want to enter the industry herself. She said she was ready to change lives! I told her to come see me when she got her license and, one year later, she did. <strong>Within her first seven months on our team, this woman sold 19 homes without any prior real estate experience.</strong></p>

<p class="indent">I love working here at The Trembley Group for the family like atmosphere with the feeling surrounding you of everyone winning. It is great to be able to ask anyone in the office a question at anytime and not feel like you are bothering someone, everyone here truly wants to help. The Trembley Group has had a huge impact on my life. When I worked at my other job I dreaded coming to work like I'm sure most people do, now I don't even feel like its work. Every day is something different and learning new and exciting things. I am just happy to be on this ride and excited to be a part of the team and look forward to helping mentor new agents as they come aboard.</p>

<p class="indent">There are many reasons why I am so glad I started working at The Trembley Group but the most outstanding reason is the amount of teamwork that goes on in our office.  Everyone supports each other.  We are all on the same team with the most amazing coach anyone in this industry could ask for.  I’m so honored to be a part of “The Trembley Group”  it has changed my business and changed my life.</p>

<p class="indent">Working at TTG consistently pushes me to strive to do better, to do more, and to not be afraid of the changes within a job because let's be real, the Real Estate world is constantly changing. When you walk into Trembley, it feels like your home away from home, because you are... you're surrounded by family.  I love our whole team of Rockstars and watching them grow and succeed. They are the reason I love my job as much as I do, the reason work doesn't feel like "work"....and that's lead to the biggest impact TTG has had on my life, I finally found the career that gives me the opportunity to help others every day. </p>

<p class="indent"></p>

<p>Many of the agents on our team have success stories just like this, because working with us is truly unique. <strong>While the average agent in our industry sells six to eight homes a year, the average number of yearly transactions for agents on our team is 40.</strong> This is because instead of struggling to find and convert leads, our agents are on the path to success. We structure a complete business plan for you, investing in branding and marketing you as an individual, and, if you choose, set you up to become a leader of your own team within our brokerage later on in your career.</p>

<p><strong>Here’s what you will learn when you begin our comprehensive 30-day onboarding process:</strong>
<ul class="indent">
<li>How to interpret, negotiate, and work with contracts</li>
<li>How to leverage our systems</li>
<li>How to begin running your business like a business from the start</li>
<li>How to convert leads</li>
<li>How to successfully perform on outbound calls</li>
<li>How to build a strong profile for you and your business</li>
<li>And much more</li>
</ul></p>

<p>If you trust our process and follow our guidance, we guarantee you will find success. The question is what level are you willing to take that success to?! The harder you work for your goals, the higher goals you’ll be able to set. We believe in dream big, achieve big.</p>

<p>After coming on board with our team, you’ll quickly understand why agents on our team say that The Trembley Group is “unlike any other.”</p>

<p>In the words of one of our team members: “The Trembley Group has helped me change so many lives, starting with my own.  I honestly believe it is the best real estate company in the world.”  </p>

<p><strong>The bottom line is this: If you take this offer, your business and your life will be completely transformed.</strong></p>
