<p><strong>Here’s what a few agents say about our free training:</strong></p>

<p class="testimonial-text indent">I was a former golf instructor, looking to make a change in careers, and I wanted to get into real estate. The #1 thing I knew I needed was coaching, training, support, mentorship and a true business plan. I met Scott and Jeremy and going to The Trembley group has given me just this, and because of this, I was able to sell 40 homes in my first year of real estate. I am thriving in the TTG work environment.</p>

<p class="testimonial-text indent">I’ve been in the business for 12 years, changing companies 4-5 times because I just couldn’t find the right fit. Up until the time I met Scott and Jeremy, the most homes I ever sold in one year was 22. My first year at TTG, because of the amazing coaching and training that Scott and Jeremy deliver, I was able to sell 50 homes. It’s been truly life changing. TTG is not only my workplace, but a family to me. My mindset is now so much stronger and my business truly runs as a business. I am so thankful for TTG.</p>

<p class="testimonial-text indent">I went to a women’s networking group, and as we stood up to present our one-minute introduction to the group of 100 women, I told them how I was formerly in the military, currently a realtor, and looking to do some babysitting on the side. After the event, the Director of Marketing from The Trembley Group, Nancy-Paige, came up to me and said, “If you join our team, I promise you will never have to babysit.” I was in the business for two years, and over the two year span, I only sold 15 homes. A few weeks after the event, I was on The Trembley Group team and I am so happy to say, I have never babysat! Due to the incredible coaching and training by Scott, Jeremy and the entire TTG team, my first year with The Trembley Group, I sold 28.</p>

<p class="testimonial-text indent">I was hired as the bartender at The Trembley Group Christmas party. During the party, Scott and Jeremy stood up and spoke about the way in which the team had changed lives - for each person at the party and also for their clients. I thought to myself, “I want to change lives!” Immediately after, unannounced to Scott or Jeremy, I went and got a telelmarketing job to create powerful phone skills, and I saved up enough money so that I could get my license and start in the business into my real estate career, I’ve already sold 19 homes. My goal for my first year is 36. I have absolute confidence under the direction of Scott, Jeremy, TTG’s Inside Sales Agents, and the incredible support team, I will absolutely sell 50 homes in my second year. I truly believe The Trembley Group is the #1 real estate company in the world! My life has been abundantly impacted.</p>
