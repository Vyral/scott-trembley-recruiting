<h1 class="join-us">Free Real Estate Business Planning Call</h1>
<h5 class="join-us-subtitle">Are you a hungry real estate agent looking for more?</h5>

<p>Dear Fellow Agent:</p>

<p>Need direction and focus to sell more homes?</p>

<p>I’ll meet with you one-on-one to help you write a business plan you can implement immediately to generate leads, appointments, and sales. </p>

<p><strong>I know how challenging it is to sell real estate.</strong></p>

<p>You have discount brokerages, competing agents, and hundreds of ways to get clients (all are not equal, I’ll tell you).</p>

<p>It can get overwhelming to stick to a consistent business plan that makes you money.</p>

<p>My name is Scott Trembley and we’ve sold over 1000 homes since April 1, 2016. </p>

<p>I want to help you sell more homes.</p>

<p>I’ll learn about your needs, goals, and why you started selling real estate. I’m happy to offer my insight on what I would do in your situation to sell more homes.</p>

<p>I will also share with you what we’re doing that works to generate leads and sales. </p>

<p>Once I understand how you like to do business that’s authentic to you (referral, prospecting, marketing, events, etc), I’ll help you write a business plan tailored just for you.</p>

<p>You’ll walk away with a plan of action, with steps you can take right away, to find homeowners who want to sell their home who list with you. </p>

<p>This will help you get the commission consistency and the freedom we all want from our business.</p>

<p class="section-title">Here’s what a few agents say about working with me…</p>

<p class="quote">I was a former golf instructor, looking to make a change in careers, and I wanted to get into real estate. The #1 thing I knew I needed was coaching, training, support, mentorship and a true business plan. I met Scott and Jeremy and going to The Trembley group has given me just this, and because of this, I was able to sell 40 homes in my first year of real estate. I am thriving in the TTG work environment.</p>

<p class="quote">I’ve been in the business for 12 years, changing companies 4-5 times because I just couldn’t find the right fit. Up until the time I met Scott and Jeremy, the most homes I ever sold in one year was 22. My first year at TTG, because of the amazing coaching and training that Scott and Jeremy deliver, I was able to sell 50 homes. It’s been truly life changing. TTG is not only my workplace, but a family to me. My mindset is now so much stronger and my business truly runs as a business. I am so thankful for TTG.</p>

<p class="quote">I went to a women’s networking group, and as we stood up to present our one-minute introduction to the group of 100 women, I told them how I was formerly in the military, currently a realtor, and looking to do some babysitting on the side. After the event, the Director of Marketing from The Trembley Group, Nancy-Paige, came up to me and said, “If you join our team, I promise you will never have to babysit.” I was in the business for two years, and over the two year span, I only sold 15 homes. A few weeks after the event, I was on The Trembley Group team and I am so happy to say, I have never babysat! Due to the incredible coaching and training by Scott, Jeremy and the entire TTG team, my first year with The Trembley Group, I sold 28. </p>

<p class="quote">I was hired as the bartender at The Trembley Group Christmas party. During the party, Scott and Jeremy stood up and spoke about the way in which the team had changed lives - for each person at the party and also for their clients. I thought to myself, “I want to change lives!” Immediately after, unannounced to Scott or Jeremy, I went and got a telelmarketing job to create powerful phone skills, and I saved up enough money so that I could get my license and start in the business into my real estate career, I’ve already sold 19 homes. My goal for my first year is 36. I have absolute confidence under the direction of Scott, Jeremy, TTG’s Inside Sales Agents, and the incredible support team, I will absolutely sell 50 homes in my second year. I truly believe The Trembley Group is the #1 real estate company in the world! My life has been abundantly impacted.</p>

<p>You don’t need to pay a bunch of money to a real estate coach.</p>

<p>Why am I offering this?</p>

<p>I’ll help you for free in return that maybe, over the long term – and only if it makes sense - you’d like to learn more about working at our team/brokerage.  </p>

<p>Let me be clear that is not the intent of the meeting. That’s another conversation for another time and only if you have any interest.</p>

<p>I also figure we’ll do business together someday and I would like to get to know you. I enjoy seeing real estate agents succeed. It’s fulfilling, and I love it.</p>

<p><strong>I invite you to request a free one-on-one business strategy meeting with me.</strong> We can meet for coffee, or even if it’s more convenient, a phone call or a video conference works, too.</p>

<p>I have a questionnaire I would like you fill out so that when we meet so I’m prepared to offer you specific advice. When you request a call, I’ll email it to you to complete before the meeting.</p>

<p>Look forward to meeting with you. Let’s grow your business.</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Scott</p>
