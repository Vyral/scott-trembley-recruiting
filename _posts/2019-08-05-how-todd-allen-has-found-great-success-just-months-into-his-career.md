I have the honor and privilege to stand here today with Todd Allen, one of our rockstar sales professionals at The Trembley Group. **This is his first year in real estate, but he’s already sold over $4 million in real estate in 2019.** I wanted to talk to him a little bit about where he’s been and where he’s headed.

Todd had a personal training business in Boise, Idaho for about nine years. After he got done with school and got tired of personal training, he moved to Nashville, Tennessee with his wife where they opened a natural essential oil business that they ran out of their house.&nbsp;

After having three kids and three years and needing a change of pace, he got into real estate.

**Fast forward seven months into his first year and Todd has done over $4 million in sales.** What has made the difference for him?&nbsp;

**According to Todd, the reason he chose The Trembley Group is that he wanted to be put into a system of success right away.** He went through boot camp, where he learned how to talk on the phone with clients, and he’s been able to use the mentorship here to his advantage. The team structure allows Todd to learn much more quickly than an agent who joins a brokerage and is then left alone.

In the beginning, Todd thought that just selling one house a month would be amazing for him and his family. He wasn’t sure if it was possible, but he knows now that it is. **He’s already sold 21 homes in 2019 alone.**

Todd is excited for his future here at The Trembley Group. We’ve got a hot market, Todd is upping his goals, and he’s ready to work harder than ever to make it happen.

**Todd’s advice for a struggling agent who isn’t sure if this is the right place for them?** “Every morning, I look forward to coming to work. If you’re someone who feels like your office is a drag, this is a place for you. We have a lot of fun here.”

If you have any questions for me about your career or about the real estate business in general, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
