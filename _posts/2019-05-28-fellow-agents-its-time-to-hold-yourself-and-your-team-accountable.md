As you know, most agents don’t track the numbers in their business as closely as they should. If you fall into this category, don’t worry—you aren’t alone. But with that in mind, today I’d like to share a few of my team’s own methods for tracking our numbers.

If you’re thinking of taking control of your business and having a better life, in general, the first step we recommend is that you read Gino Wickman’s incredible book, “Traction.”

**In addition to taking lessons from this book, our team has implemented a coaching scorecard.** We track appointments, sales, goals, and more for each and every agent. Agents are given points for their performance in each of these categories.&nbsp;

This gives us a clear idea of which of our agents are following the sales pipeline effectively, while simultaneously making us aware of the agents who could use some additional guidance. This is what makes tracking numbers so vital. When we’re able to pinpoint our areas of weakness, we can use this knowledge to improve.&nbsp;

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
