As you remember from my previous video, a home equity conversion mortgage (HECM) is a type of loan designed for people aged 62 or older that allows them to buy a primary residence by making just one down payment and no additional mortgage payments for the rest of their lives.&nbsp;

We know how this loan program benefits buyers, but what about Realtors? That’s the question my friend and associate Larry Reed and I will answer today.&nbsp;

Follow along in the video above to see our full conversation recapping how this program benefits buyer and how Realtors can use it to better service their clients. **Once again, I’ve provided timestamps so you can skip ahead to various sections at your leisure:**
