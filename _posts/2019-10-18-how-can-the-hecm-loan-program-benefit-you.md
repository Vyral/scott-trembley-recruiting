Today I’m joined by Larry Reed of Retirement Funding Solutions to discuss the home equity conversion mortgage (HECM). This is a unique type of mortgage designed for people aged 62 or older who are buying a primary residence.&nbsp;

The Myrtle Beach market is a big retiree market, and let’s face it: Nobody wants a mortgage in retirement. The HECM allows people in this situation to make a one-time down payment and never have to worry about a mortgage payment again for the rest of their lives.&nbsp;

Follow along in the video above to see our full conversation of how this mortgage works and how it can benefit you. I’ve also provided timestamps so you can skip ahead to various sections at your leisure:
