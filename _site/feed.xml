        <title>What to Do When Your Buyer Wants to See 30 Homes</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/9zFps2t5PTo?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;present-before-paste present-before-paste&quot;&gt;What do you do when a client wants you to show them 30 homes? As an agent, there are several key tips you must remember and steps you must take in order to guide your clients through a timely, successful home purchase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;present-before-paste&quot;&gt;First, remember that &lt;strong&gt;you must always be a leader.&lt;/strong&gt; In every relationship, someone has to lead and someone has to follow. So, when it comes to the real estate process, you must be a leader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;present-before-paste&quot;&gt;Second, &lt;strong&gt;you have to have energy, enthusiasm, and confidence.&lt;/strong&gt; This ties in with the first point—people will respect and follow someone who has energy, enthusiasm, and confidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;present-before-paste&quot;&gt;Third, &lt;strong&gt;always have a plan.&lt;/strong&gt; This applies whether you’re showing homes or doing a listing presentation. Just like people will respect someone with energy, enthusiasm, and confidence, they’ll also respect someone who has a plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;present-before-paste&quot;&gt;Now that you know these main points, how do you apply them to the actual process?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;present-before-paste&quot;&gt;First, &lt;strong&gt;take a minute and slow down.&lt;/strong&gt; Sales agents sometimes get so excited on the front end of their client relationship that the back end becomes a mess. So, start asking your client why they want to see these 30 homes and what they are looking for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;present-before-paste&quot;&gt;To find this out, you need to &lt;strong&gt;identify their LPMAMA:&lt;/strong&gt; their preferred location, price, motivation, agent (make sure they’re not working with anyone else), mortgage (will they finance or pay cash?), and appointment time. Asking deep-level questions about all of these factors will help you understand what they’re looking for in a home while they still want to see 30 homes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;present-before-paste&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Their goal is to find the home they want and get into it as quickly as possible, and it’s your job to have an elimination and simplification strategy in place to make that happen.%20localhost:4000/what-to-do-when-your-buyer-wants-to-see-30-homes.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Their goal is to find the home they want and get into it as quickly as possible, and it’s your job to have an elimination and simplification strategy in place to make that happen.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;present-before-paste&quot;&gt;Now that you’ve narrowed the process down and you understand what your buyer is looking for, you need to &lt;strong&gt;summarize with them everything you’ve spoken about&lt;/strong&gt; to make sure you’re both on the same page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;present-before-paste&quot;&gt;After you’re done summarizing, you need to &lt;strong&gt;eliminate and simplify.&lt;/strong&gt; This is a very important step in this business. Take the summary of their 30 homes, discuss each one with them, and eliminate which ones won’t work. Your goal should be to simplify the list down to three to five homes by the time you meet with them. At the end of the process (or even during), they’ll thank you for taking this step and not wasting their time. Remember, their goal is to find the home they want and get into it as quickly as possible, and it’s your job to have an elimination and simplification strategy in place to make that happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;present-before-paste&quot;&gt;I sometimes joke that agents who don’t take this step and actually end up showing 30 homes to their clients are like one-legged ducks walking in a circle. We’re in a resort market here, so even after their client buys their primary residence, they sometimes go back home feeling confused, so those agents have to then spend their time reeling that client back in. During that time, they may end up reaching out to another agent who can simplify the process for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;present-before-paste&quot;&gt;Don’t be that agent. Be the one who goes through each of these steps thoroughly. After that, it’s go time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;present-before-paste&quot;&gt;If you have any other questions about this process or there’s anything else I can help you with, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to speak with you.&lt;/p&gt;
