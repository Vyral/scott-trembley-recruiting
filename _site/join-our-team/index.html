<p>Dear Fellow or Future Real Estate Agent:</p>

<p>We understand that right now you may be frustrated with the current state of your career. Perhaps you’ve already found success in the real estate industry, but find yourself lacking in the consistency, support, and direction you desire. Even those with the drive and skill to produce between $1 and $10 million in sales may feel this same exasperation. Without the right environment, agents are simply unable to thrive.</p>

<p>Or perhaps you are working as a sales professional in another industry, but have been considering the switch to a real estate career.</p>

<p>In either case, the bottom line is this: Something has to change. Yet, as those of you already in the industry will know, not every brokerage out there will offer you a path to true success. <strong>Did you know that 87% of people who get their real estate license will drop out of the industry in their first two to five years?</strong> That means nine out of every 10 agents fail before they ever really get a chance to win. So why does this happen?</p>

<p>As I mentioned before, most brokerages don’t offer agents any support. This leaves agents to fend for themselves, spending their own money and resources on tools and tactics that never seem to pay off. <strong>To achieve long-term success, agents need support, structure, coaching, training, accountability, marketing and, of course, leads.</strong></p>

<p>Getting into a real estate career can either feel like the best or the worst decision in your life. The difference comes down to the environment you choose, and how you use that environment to your advantage. The right resources and support can take your career from bleak to booming, and this is exactly what we at The Trembley Group are offering you.</p>

<p>Our mission here at The Trembley Group is to deliver 6-star (not just 5-star) service to every client, partner, agent we work with, and to our own team members as well. Our goal has been to be the No. 1 reviewed company in our market and, eventually, in the real estate industry, overall.</p>

<p>Right now, we are the No. 1 reviewed company on Zillow in our market. With 740 + positive reviews on that platform, we’re well on our way to being one of the top-reviewed companies in our industry.</p>

<p><img src="/img/team.jpg" class="team-pic" /><figcaption class="caption">The Trembley Group Real Estate</figcaption></p>

<p><strong>My name is Scott Trembley, and today I’m going to tell you why joining our team is your best bet at success in this industry.</strong> I’ve been in real estate for more than 20 years, have helped over 4,000 families achieve their real estate goals, and have trained more than 100 agents in the past 10 years. All that said, I know what it takes to succeed in real estate.</p>

<p>In the short time since I founded The Trembley Group three years ago, we have been recognized as the fastest-growing team in our market. Whether you’re working in sales in another industry and are thinking of making a change, or you’re already an agent but crave more direction, we can help put you on the path to a better career and a better life.</p>

<p>According to the Coastal Carolina Association of Realtors, The Trembley Group is the place to go if you want to learn the business and learn it fast. <strong>Here are just a few of the resources we offer to our agents:</strong>
<ul class="indent">
<li>High-level coaching</li>
<li>Mentorship program for brand new agents </li>
<li>Mastermind groups, Mentoring &amp; Role-play sessions</li>
<li>In-depth training</li>
<li>Bonus plans </li>
<li>Real accountability</li>
<li>The best customer resource management (CRM) system in the Industry</li>
<li>Your own website</li>
<li>Individual branding and marketing</li>
<li>Marketing Team that markets your listings</li>
<li>6-star Support from our Transaction Department </li>
<li>7-days-a-week 6-star Support from our elite Inside Sales Agent (ISA) team</li>
<li>An encouraging and uplifting culture that is second-to-none</li>
<li>Built-in Raving Fan Referral Plan to keep in touch with all your past clients</li>
<li>Systems that work</li>
<li>Office and desk space</li>
<li>Not just LEADS but 15 to 25 Qualified appointments monthly </li>
<li>And much more</li>
</ul></p>

<p>We have studied the top Real Estate teams/firms in the United States for the last three years to lay out a scaled commission package that is second-to-none in our industry giving the above resources and crazy value our company brings to its superstar agents. We are also the only firm in this area that is set up for strong leaders looking to build their own team within our incredible environment.  (ACTIVE AGENTS PRODUCING IN OUR MARKET TODAY WOULD START AT THE COMMISSION LEVEL THAT MATCHES THEIR CURRENT ANNUAL PRODUCTION. IE: AN AGENT PRODUCING $6M+ IN THEIR LAST 12 MONTHS WOULD START AT THE THIRD FEARLESS LEVEL).</p>

<p>Our Commission Structure:</p>

<p><strong>HEART LEVEL</strong> — Up To $2.5 Million In Closed Volume —
Brand New Agents: 60% commission on self-generated business &amp; 40% on qualified company leads. You have an in-house mentor at this level.</p>

<p><strong>COACHABLE LEVEL</strong> — $2.5M To $6M In Closed Volume —
Second Tier: 70% commission on self-generated business &amp; 45% on qualified company leads. An additional 10% bonus each month on the third sale &amp; beyond on company-generated business.</p>

<p><strong>FEARLESS LEVEL</strong> — $6 Million+ In Closed Volume —
Third Tier: 75% commission on self-generated business &amp; 50% on qualified company leads. An additional 10% bonus each month on the third sale &amp; beyond on company-generated business.</p>

<p>The reason we offer all of this is simple. We want our agents to be more than just great real estate professionals; we want our agents to develop into the most trusted leaders in the industry. By joining our team, you’ll be on the fast track to helping upwards of 40 families on an annual basis, while also earning six figures and beyond once you enter your second year.</p>

<p><strong>You could try one of these alternative options:</strong>
<ol class="indent">
<li>You could work for a competing broker and pay for your own materials and training with no success to show for it.</li>
<li>You could sell 4-8 homes a year with no business plan or strategically sell 38 + homes annually with us.</li>
<li>You could try to start your own team with no support and struggle to maintain a balance between hiring, training, selling, and more.</li>
<li>You could leave the industry or stay in your current 9-to-5 with no end goal in sight.</li>
</ol></p>

<p><strong>But why test your luck at replicating the kind of success that, when you join us, is a sure thing?</strong> If you follow the path we’ve laid out, you’ll find your goals are much closer than you think. At The Trembley Group, we offer you the chance to build a career and a life you want, all while allowing you the freedom to enjoy that life. Encouraging strong families is as important to us as encouraging strong real estate careers. This commitment is part of what sets our team apart, along with our core values—which are:
<ul class="indent">
<li>Winning Attitude</li>
<li>Coachable</li>
<li>Heart</li>
<li>Fearless</li>
<li>The 100/0 Principle: 100% accountability, zero excuses.</li>
</ul></p>

<p>But don’t just take my word for it. <strong>Consider these success stories from some of our great agents:</strong></p>

<p class="indent">"During the Christmas party we held at the end of our first year in business, our team was sitting around and sharing our favorite memories from the year. We laughed, cried, and reminisced about all the ways our lives (and the lives of our clients) had changed. When the bartender who was working at the party heard this, she chimed in and told us that hearing our stories made her want to enter the industry herself. She said she was ready to change lives! I told her to come see me when she got her license and one year later, she did. <strong>Within her first seven months on our team, this woman sold 19 homes without any prior real estate experience."</strong></p>

<p class="indent">"I love working here at The Trembley Group for the family-like atmosphere as well as the surrounding feeling of everyone winning. It is great to be able to ask anyone in the office a question at any time and not feel like you are bothering someone ... everyone here truly wants to help. The Trembley Group has had a huge impact on my life. When I worked at my other job I dreaded going to work, as I'm sure most people do. Now, I don't even feel like it's work. Every day is something different, learning new and exciting things. I am just happy to be on this ride and excited to be a part of the team. I look forward to mentoring new agents as they come aboard."</p>

<p class="indent">"There are many reasons why I am so glad I started working at The Trembley Group, but the most outstanding reason is the amount of teamwork that happens in our office. Everyone supports each other. We are all on the same team with the most amazing coach anyone in this industry could ask for. I’m so honored to be a part of “The Trembley Group”.  It has changed my business and changed my life."</p>

<p class="indent">"Working at TTG consistently pushes me to strive to do better, to do more, and to not be afraid of the changes within a job because let's be real, the real estate world is constantly changing. When you walk into Trembley, it feels like your home away from home, because ... you're surrounded by family. I love our whole team of rock stars and watching them grow and succeed. They are the reason I love my job as much as I do, the reason work doesn't feel like "work". This has all led to the biggest impact TTG has had on my life ... I finally found the career that gives me the opportunity to help others every day."</p>

<p class="indent">"After 30 years of working in the Healthcare industry, I decided it was time for a change and got my realtor license. After asking around about recommendations for a real estate firm that might be a good fit for me, The Trembley Group was recommended time after time for the quality training program they offered to new agents, terrific leadership, integrity and an overall awesome place to work. I interviewed with Scott Trembley who was warm, open, honest and welcoming. Working at the Trembley Group has been a very rewarding experience offering me the opportunity to learn, grow, make new friends and become the best realtor I can be. Every day is a new chance to better me and excel in my new career. Everyone here has a perpetual smile on their face, a helpful attitude and are always willing to take a moment to answer a question even though I know they are busy with their own tasks. I honestly cannot remember ever going to work and seeing everyone happy, laughing, looking forward to what the day will bring and making a difference in someone's life on a daily basis. I am so happy working here and feel very blessed to be part of The Trembley Group. Thank you for allowing me to be part of The Trembley Experience!"</p>

<p class="indent">"I love and adore working at The Trembley Group! Working here has provided me with the opportunity to direct my skills towards power, productivity, and success. Scott Trembley and Jeremy Jenks are supportive, have my back and want the best for me - consistently. I feel very appreciated, which is an incredible feeling to have at work! And I’m not the only one who is appreciated. Overall, The Trembley Group is culture-focused, putting their people first and truly caring. We have a lot of laughs - my colleagues are incredible - and as we like to say, also GSD (Get Shit Done ;-). One of the most important differences The Trembley Group has made in my life is around my mindset. I have been an avid seeker of self-improvement my whole life, and working here has taken my mindset to another level - a masterful level. It is said to be successful in life and business, surround yourself with great minds and in choosing to work here, I have done just that. In the two and a half years I have been here, often visitors say, “It smells like energy here in your offices!” It is true! The energy is contagious, uplifting and inspiring. It is literally tangible. I’m just not convinced that this exists anywhere else in Myrtle Beach or along the Grand Strand - especially in real estate. I feel like I won the lottery finding my work-home at The Trembley Group. We truly are unique and looking for unique people to join our team! Is that you?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Working for the Trembley Group is the best choice I have made. I'm surrounded by a great group of rock stars who are uplifting and encouraging. The training is ongoing and at an elite status. This company is always changing with the times and never stagnant. My real estate business has never been better. Big 'thanks' to Scott Trembley and Jeremy Jenks for forming this company and allowing me to be a part of it! Always learning and growing!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Working with The Trembley Group has transformed my life! Every day I get the chance to make a difference and help change lives. I work with unbelievable colleagues and am part of a culture that was previously nonexistent in any other workplace. I love the excitement of what each new day brings and having the freedom to develop my business, be myself, manage my time and learn and grow with this group of people. For the first time, I feel like I have a grip on life and I am so grateful for that."</p>

<p class="indent">"There are many reasons why I love working with TTG. I absolutely love the team environment. It's truly one-of-a-kind and you can feel the support from each person on this team every single day. Everyone wants to see each other succeed and grow, not only as a real estate professional but as an individual in all aspects of life. It has impacted my business and life by me continuously learning, holding myself accountable, and removing the doubt and fear to allow myself to believe "I can", and have the confidence to improve every day."</p>

<p>Many of the agents on our team have success stories just like this because working with us is truly unique. <strong>While the average agent in our industry sells six to eight homes a year, the average number of yearly transactions for agents on our team is 40.</strong> This is because instead of struggling to find and convert leads, our agents are on the path to success. We structure a complete business plan for you, investing in branding and marketing you as an individual, and, if you choose, set you up to become a leader of your own team within our brokerage later on in your career.</p>

<p><strong>Here’s what you will learn when you begin our comprehensive 30-day onboarding process:</strong>
<ul class="indent">
<li>How to interpret, negotiate, and work with contracts</li>
<li>How to leverage our systems</li>
<li>How to begin running your business like a business from the start</li>
<li>How to convert leads</li>
<li>How to successfully perform on outbound calls</li>
<li>How to build a strong profile for you and your business</li>
<li>And much more</li>
</ul></p>

<p>If you trust our process and follow our guidance, we guarantee you will find success. The question is what level are you willing to take that success to?! The harder you work for your goals, the higher goals you’ll be able to set. We believe in dream big, achieve big.</p>

<p>After coming on board with our team, you’ll quickly understand why agents on our team say that The Trembley Group is “unlike any other.”</p>

<p>In the words of one of our team members: “The Trembley Group has helped me change so many lives, starting with my own. I honestly believe it is the best real estate company in the world.”</p>

<p><strong>The bottom line is this: If you take this offer, your business and your life will be completely transformed.</strong></p>

<p>If you have any other questions or would like to get started in the process of joining our team, give me a call or send me an email today. I look forward to hearing from you soon.</p>

<p>I’d be happy to answer any other questions you may have about our team if you just give us a call or send us an email today. We look forward to hearing from you soon.</p>
